## We Got Coders Women's Workshop

In May 2016, we organised a women's coding workshop that helped newbie developers
try their hand at coding. After a short lesson on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we
demonstrated the HTML5 web speech API and explained how it worked. After just a
few short hours, the team of 6 ladies put together a noughts and crosses game,
using voice activation as the trigger.
